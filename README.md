# Maine-Weather
The data is from a subset of The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Daily Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN-Daily). The GHCN-Daily is comprised of daily climate records from thousands of land surface stations across the globe.
The data for this project comes from stations throughout Maine, United States. Each row in the datafile corresponds to a single observation.
The data is used to produce a line graph of the record high and record low temperatures by day of the year over the period 2005-2014 overlaying a scatter of the 2015 data for any points (highs and lows) when the ten-year (2005-2014) record high or record low was broken in 2015.
